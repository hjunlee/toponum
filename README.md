# toponum
The Toponum is the package which evaluates the topological numbers for materials with non-trivial topology. It is highly efficient and suitable to the high-throughput search for topological materials.

# Done
 1. Exploit symmetry+TR in terms of PWs (QE, VASP)
 2. NC,USPP (QE)
 3. Parallelization (QE, VASP)
 4. Z2, Z, MZ, Z4 (QE, VASP)
 
# TODO
 1. WIEN2k
 2. PAW one-center (QE): necessary?
 3. Wannier90
